Perfect — this is a very good example for analyzing **string and list operations together**.
Let’s break the time and space complexity step by step 👇

### 🔹 Code Recap

```python
sentence = input("Enter a sentence:")
words = sentence.split(' ')
for x in range(len(words)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        words[x] = words[x][::-1]
print(f"Modified sentence:{' '.join(words)}")
```

Let:

- `n` = total number of characters in the sentence
- `k` = number of words
- Average word length = `m ≈ n/k`

---

## 🔸 Step 1: `split(' ')`

`sentence.split(' ')` scans the string once and splits by spaces.

- ⏱️ Time: **O(n)** — every character is checked once.
- 💾 Space: **O(n)** — stores list of `k` words (total characters ≈ n).

---

## 🔸 Step 2: Loop Over `words`

Loop runs `k` times.

For **even-indexed** words → we do `words[x][::-1]`.

Let’s see what happens there 👇

---

### 🔹 Slicing Reversal (`[::-1]`)

- Each reversal copies all characters of that word once.
  → **O(length_of_word)**

If half the words (roughly k/2) are reversed:

- Total characters reversed ≈ n/2
  So total time = **O(n)**.

---

## 🔸 Step 3: `' '.join(words)`

The `join` method concatenates all words with a single pass.

- ⏱️ Time: **O(n)**
- 💾 Space: **O(n)** (creates the final output string).

## ✅ Final Complexities

| Operation                  | Time     | Space                    |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| `split(' ')`               | O(n)     | O(n)                     |
| Reverse even-indexed words | O(n)     | O(1) extra (reused list) |
| `' '.join(words)`          | O(n)     | O(n)                     |
| **Total**                  | **O(n)** | **O(n)**                 |

---

### 🔹 Summary:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  (all operations together scale linearly with input size)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  (due to storing words list + final joined string)
